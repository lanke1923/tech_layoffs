# Tech Layoffs Analysis

## Overview

This project is an analysis of tech layoffs that occurred from 2022 to 2023. The analysis is based on a dataset containing 9 columns and 287 rows of data after cleaning, data import, and data transformation using various Excel functions like nested IFS, VLOOKUP, and Power Query. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the tech layoffs, identify trends, and visualize the findings through a dashboard.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and represents tech layoffs in the United States during the specified time frame. The data was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and relevance to the analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data underwent a series of cleaning and transformation steps, including:

- **Data Import**: The raw data was imported into Excel for analysis.

- **Data Cleanup**: Various data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

- **Formulas**: Excel functions like nested IFS and VLOOKUP were used to calculate and derive additional insights from the dataset.

- **Power Query**: Power Query was utilized to shape and structure the data for analysis.

- **Outliers Removal**: Two outliers from Mumbai and Israel were removed from the dataset, as the scope of the analysis was limited to the United States.

## Key Findings

1. **Industry with the Most Layoffs**: The analysis reveals that the E-commerce industry had the highest number of layoffs during the specified period.

2. **Public Companies Lead in Layoffs**: Public companies accounted for the majority of layoffs compared to private companies.

## Dashboard

To visualize and communicate the major insights from the analysis, a dashboard was created. The dashboard includes various charts, graphs, and tables that provide a clear overview of the key findings. It allows stakeholders to easily grasp the trends and patterns in the data.

## Conclusion
